## Step 1 : Setup your IDE(vs-code)

    * first install git from " https://git-scm.com/downloads "
    * then open the terminal or Bash terminal from your computer on right click form your desktop
    * Create a folder with any name you like using command eg: ( mkdir ideationX )
    * now open your vs code and open that folder that you have created in vs code.

## Step 2 : How to clone and setup the project

    * Copy the SHH " https://github.com/Ideation-X/LearnerAcademy.git " link from CODE button, on right side of add-file
    * then got to your vs-code and one your terminal in vscode
    * then write this command eg: git clone <paste ssh link you copied here>
    * if you face any error then make sure that you have already installed git - To check command ( git ) in
      terminal of vscode if there is any error then install git first.
    * Now you can see in vs-code in left sidebar that the project is downloaded in your computer
    * Now you can make any changes in the project you want

## Step 3 : How to create pull request after making changes

    * In vs-code in side bar go to source-control just down the search icon
    * then click three dots > click Branch >  click Create Branch > Your Branch name should be your name
    * now go to that branch > you will see main branch on footer of the vs-code just left in corner and switch to your branch
    * Write the message by writing your name first like eg: ( shahma : created the side bar )
    * Now click commit and wait for few seconds
    * Now go to github and open the repository tha you forked and go to your branch from main branch
    * and you will see the option of " create pull request " on the side of your branch name
